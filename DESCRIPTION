Description: Includes four functions: RFactor_calc(), RFactor_est(), KFactor() and SoilLoss(). The rainfall erosivity factors can be calculated or estimated, and soil erodibility will be estimated by the equation extracted from the monograph. Soil loss will be estimated by the product of five factors (rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, length and steepness slope, cover-management factor and support practice factor. In the future, additional functions can be included. This efforts to advance research in soil and water conservation, with fast and accurate results.
